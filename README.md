# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are optimized, reusable solutions to programming problems that programmers encounter every day. A Design Pattern is a description or a template for solving a problem that can be used in various situations. It is not language specific, i.e. any programming language can implement it. A good Design Pattern should be implemented in most, if not all, languages, depending on the capabilities of the language.
