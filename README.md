# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are optimized, reusable solutions to programming problems that programmers encounter every day. A Design Pattern is a description or a template for solving a problem that can be used in various situations. It is not language specific, i.e. any programming language can implement it. A good Design Pattern should be implemented in most, if not all, languages, depending on the capabilities of the language.

### There are three types of Design Patterns:

#### Creational:
- Abstract Factory :heavy_check_mark:
- Builder :heavy_check_mark:
- Factory Method :heavy_check_mark:
- Object Pool :heavy_check_mark:
- Prototype :heavy_check_mark:
- Singleton :heavy_check_mark:

#### Structural:
- Adapter :heavy_check_mark:
- Bridge :heavy_check_mark:
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Private Class Data
- Proxy

#### Behavioral:
- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Null Object
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template method
- Visitor

Generally the three groups above define how objects in your program relate to each other, how they are created, and how they communicate with each other.
